# DBSCAN
To implement DBSCAN algorithms to cluster the 3 datasets with blob, moon and circle structures. 
Design and implement DBSCAN algorithm to cluster the 3 datasets mentioned.
Assume hyperparameters wherever necessary.
Use Silhouette index to evaluate the clustering quality.
Run dataset for the K-means algorithm implemented in assignment 
Set the num_clusters for K-means to the no. of clusters from DBSCAN.
Compare it to DBSCAN in terms of cluster visualization and Silhouette index score
